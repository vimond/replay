The expanded/collapsed state and filtering dropdown items based on entered characters, are examples of data that are not wise to manage in Redux and with Flux actions.`}</MDXTag>\n<MDXTag name=\"p\" components={components}>{`Further, Redux state works best with \"singletons\" in a page.

Still the state and playback API needs to be \"lifted up\" from the video streamer component so it can be exposed downwards to player UI components, and significant amounts of \"plumbing\" is needed. Besides, it is hard to design this with optimal performance in mind. Every time the playback position is updated, the prop set is changed, and from the top of the player UI tree, a rerender will be required down to the components actually consuming the playback position.

It makes it easy to share and scope state in a branch/part of the rendered React element tree.
