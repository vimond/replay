# Bitrates and adaptive quality selection

Bitrates and adaptive quality selection in Replay is supported through third party player integrations, namely several different `<...VideoStreamer/>` components included in the Replay package. Two of these integrate the most common and mature open source alternatives,
HLS.js and Shaka Player. Both adaptive quality selection and manual quality selection options are available in Replay. Also, there are some options to control bitrates selection both in adaptive quality selection and manual quality selection.

Examples of the different bitrates and adaptive quality selection use case might be for both HLS and DASH streams.

## Adaptive quality selection

### Automatic selection

By default, Replay handles quality switch automatically, using heuristics based on fragment loading bitrate and quality level bandwidth exposed in the variant manifest.

The following example contains `QualitySelection` options in Replay and hovering over the options there will be available bitrates of the stream and an indicator will point
to the currently streaming bitrate. 

<Playground>
  <Replay
    source={{
             streamUrl: 'public/example-media/adaptive.m3u8',
             contentType: 'application/x-mpegurl'
           }}
    initialPlaybackProps={{ isPaused: true }}>
    <CompoundVideoStreamer/>
  </Replay>
</Playground>

### Capped selection

From the available bitrates in `QualitySelection` options in Replay, When a specific bitrate is selected then it will indicate a maximum bitrate to be considered for adaptive
bitrate switching.

The following example contains `QualitySelection` options in Replay and hovering over the options there will be available bitrates of the stream and an indicator will point
to the current streaming bitrate. Then a specific bitrate can be selected and Replay will consider it the maximum bitrate for adaptive switching.

<Playground>
  <Replay
    source={{
             streamUrl: 'public/example-media/adaptive.m3u8',
             contentType: 'application/x-mpegurl'
           }}
    initialPlaybackProps={{ isPaused: true }}>
    <CompoundVideoStreamer/>
  </Replay>
</Playground>

## Manual quality selection

### Smooth switch

While the manual quality selection strategy(`fix-bitrate`) is enabled with `smooth-switch` strategy in Replay, user can select among different available bitrates of streams.
When selecting a specific bitrate among different bitrates, The switching won't be at the right away. After already buffered streaming segment of previously selected bitrate
is played out, the switching will happen. By default, `smooth-switch` strategy is enabled in Replay with manual quality selection (`fix-bitrate`).

The following example contains both override base configuration of Repaly for enabling manual smooth quality selection and ways to pass that overridden configuration.

<Playground>
  <Replay
    source={{
             streamUrl: 'public/example-media/adaptive.m3u8',
             contentType: 'application/x-mpegurl'
           }}
    options={{
      controls: {
        qualitySelectionStrategy: 'fix-bitrate'
      },
    }}
    initialPlaybackProps={{ isPaused: true }}>
    <CompoundVideoStreamer/>
  </Replay>
</Playground>

### Instant switch

While the manual bitrate selection strategy(`fix-bitrate`) is enabled with `instant-switch` strategy in Replay, user can select among different available bitrates of streams.
At the time of selecting a specific bitrate among different bitrates, The bitrate will be selected right away. For enabling `smooth-switch` strategy of `fix-bitrate` in Replay,
user has to override base configuration.

The following example contains both override base configuration of Repaly for enabling manual instant quality selection and ways to pass that overridden configuration.

<Playground>
  <Replay
    source={{
             streamUrl: 'public/example-media/adaptive.m3u8',
             contentType: 'application/x-mpegurl'
           }}
    options={{
      videoStreamer: {
        manualBitrateSwitchStrategy: 'instant-switch'
      },
      controls: {
        qualitySelectionStrategy: 'fix-bitrate'
      },
    }}
    initialPlaybackProps={{ isPaused: true }}>
    <CompoundVideoStreamer/>
  </Replay>
</Playground>
