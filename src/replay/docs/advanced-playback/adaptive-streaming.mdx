# Playing adaptive streams

Adaptive streaming in Replay is supported through third party player integrations, namely several different `<...VideoStreamer/>` components included in the Replay package. Two of these integrate the most common and mature open source alternatives, HLS.js and Shaka Player. They correspondingly cover HLS and MPEG-DASH technologies (however the development appears to extend beyond the original target technology). These two components are named `<HlsjsVideoStreamer/>` and `<ShakaVideoStreamer/>`.

Unless DRM encryption is needed for the adaptive streams to be played with Replay, the best strategy is to have all streams in one of the formats (HLS and MPEG-DASH). Unencrypted, either of these can play with the corresponding third party integration in all modern browsers.

If DRM playback must be supported, or if the different streams to be played have different formats, then Replay provides a helper component resolving what `VideoStreamer` that fits the stream. 

Examples of the different stream formats use case might be some DASH streams and MP4 files, or perhaps both HLS and DASH streams.

## Enabling playback for a single adaptive streaming technology

### HLS with HLS.js

Add an import statement for the HLS.js video streamer component:

```javascript
import { Replay } from 'vimond-replay';
import 'vimond-replay/index.css';
import HlsjsVideoStreamer from 'vimond-replay/video-streamer/hlsjs';
```

Add the `<HlsjsVideoStreamer/>` component as the child of `<Replay/>`. This simply includes the HLS.js library through the VideoStreamer wrapping component.

<Playground>
  <Replay
    source="public/example-media/adaptive.m3u8"
    initialPlaybackProps={{ isPaused: true }}>
    <HlsjsVideoStreamer/>
  </Replay>
</Playground>

Remember that the HLS.js library is actually playing the stream. Refer to the [project homepage](https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js/) for documentation on what's supported, troubleshooting playback, expected behaviour, etc.

Note that with this code, Replay's support for progressively downloaded MP4/WebM files is substituted, and such files are not supported.

If specific HLS.js configuration settings need to be set, they can be added like this:

```javascript
const replayOptions = {
  videoStreamer: {
    hlsjs: {
      customConfiguration: {
        capLevelToPlayerSize: true,
        maxBufferLength: 45
      }
    }
  }
};
// Pass this object to Replay as a configuration override:
const render = () => (
  <Replay
    source="public/example-media/adaptive.m3u8"
    options={replayOptions}>
    <HlsjsVideoStreamer/>
  </Replay>
);
```

### MPEG-DASH with Shaka Player

The Shaka Player video streamer component can be imported with the import statement added at the end:

```javascript
import { Replay } from 'vimond-replay';
import 'vimond-replay/index.css';
import ShakaVideoStreamer from 'vimond-replay/video-streamer/shaka-player';
```

Add the `<ShakaVideoStreamer/>` component as the child of `<Replay/>`. This simply includes the Shaka Player library through the VideoStreamer wrapping component.

<Playground>
  <Replay
    source="https://storage.googleapis.com/shaka-demo-assets/angel-one/dash.mpd"
    initialPlaybackProps={{ isPaused: true }}>
    <ShakaVideoStreamer/>
  </Replay>
</Playground>

Remember that Shaka Player is actually playing the stream. Refer to the [project homepage](https://github.com/google/shaka-player/) for documentation on what's supported, troubleshooting playback, expected behaviour, etc.

Note that with this code, Replay's support for progressively downloaded MP4/WebM files is substituted, and such files are not supported.

If specific Shaka Player configuration settings need to be set, they can be added like this:

```javascript
const replayOptions = {
  videoStreamer: {
    shaka: {
      customConfiguration: {
        streaming: {
          bufferingGoal: 120
        }
      }
    }
  }
};
// Pass this object to Replay as a configuration override:
const render = () => (
  <Replay
    source="https://storage.googleapis.com/shaka-demo-assets/angel-one/dash.mpd"
    options={replayOptions}>
    <ShakaVideoStreamer/>
  </Replay>
);
```

## Enabling playback for multiple streaming technologies based on stream technology resolution

The helper commponent `<VideoStreamerResolver/>`'s task is to select a compatible video streamer for Replay based on the stream type, and in a special case, also taking the browser into consideration. 

For HLS, it inserts `<HlsjsVideoStreamer/>`, for MPEG-DASH `<ShakaVideoStreamer/>`. A progressive video source resolves to `<HtmlVideoStreamer/>`. The mentioned special case is the combination of Safari and HLS streams. Safari and the Apple operating systems support HLS natively, and the HTML video element play these streams optimally without any third party library. For this combination, the video streamer resolver then selects `<HtmlVideoStreamer/>`. It includes support for FairPlay DRM.

The mentioned third party player libraries are quite big, and adds several hundred kilobytes to the script bundle. Because of this, `<VideoStreamerResolver/>` uses [React.lazy](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#reactlazy) and [dynamic imports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import#Dynamic_Imports). It loads only one video streamer and its integrated third party library when needed.

The stream type is resolved based on the source prop. The source prop should then ideally be an object containing the mime type associated with the resource specified by the stream URL. This is an example for HLS:

```javascript
const hlsSource = {
  streamUrl: 'public/example-media/adaptive.m3u8',
  contentType: 'application/x-mpegurl'
};
```

The recognised mime types are as follows:

* MPEG-DASH: `application/dash+xml`
* HLS: `application/x-mpegurl`, alternatively `vnd.apple.mpegurl`
* Progressive MP4 or WebM: `video/mp4`, `video/webm`

If the source is only specified as a string containing the URL to the manifest, playlist, or video file, the video streamer resolver attempts detecting the stream type based on URL content.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Replay } from 'vimond-replay';
import 'vimond-replay/index.css';
import VideoStreamerResolver from 'vimond-replay/video-streamer/resolver';
```

The following example resolves to inserting the HlsjsVideoStreamer for the specified source, unless this page is viewed in Safari, where HtmlVideoStreamer is selected.

<Playground>
  <Replay
    source={{
             streamUrl: 'public/example-media/adaptive.m3u8',
             contentType: 'application/x-mpegurl'
           }}
    initialPlaybackProps={{ isPaused: true }}>
    <VideoStreamerResolver/>
  </Replay>
</Playground>

The following example selects the ShakaVideoStreamer for the specified source string. The manifest URL contains `.mpd`, which makes the video streamer resolver guess that this is a MPEG-DASH manifest.

<Playground>
  <Replay
    source="https://storage.googleapis.com/shaka-demo-assets/angel-one/dash.mpd"
    initialPlaybackProps={{ isPaused: true }}>
    <VideoStreamerResolver/>
  </Replay>
</Playground>

As for individual video streamer components, `<VideoStreamerResolver/>` should be inserted as `<Replay/>`'s child element. It renders the resolved video streamer component based on the source prop passed down from Replay.

Configuration for all video streamer components (inserted individually or through the video streamer resolver) can be specified in the same override object.

```javascript
const replayOptions = {
  videoStreamer: {
    hlsjs: {
      customConfiguration: {
        capLevelToPlayerSize: true,
        maxBufferLength: 45
      }
    },
    shaka: {
      customConfiguration: {
        streaming: {
          bufferingGoal: 120
        }
      }
    }
  }
};
```
